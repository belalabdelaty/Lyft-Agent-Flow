# 🚗 Lyft Agent Helper

A smart internal tool built for Lyft support agents to **cut down Average Handle Time (AHT)** and make each interaction smoother, faster, and more accurate.  

Over **100 agents** are already using it daily — and it’s making a real impact on speed, consistency, and overall customer experience.

## ⚡ What It Does

This project started as a small automation idea and turned into a full-fledged workflow tool.  
It integrates directly with Lyft’s internal systems and helps agents:

- 🔍 Access relevant data instantly  
- 💬 Get context-aware response suggestions  
- 🧾 Automate repetitive text and ticket actions  
- 📊 Track and optimize AHT per interaction  

Everything runs on a **Google Apps Script backend** hosted [here](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwfvNBeE7RIosqsrTgzSZCn8HY5OuubKSoDM17pLpLAB5IMmrRQIggcoAG90AD7mjHM0A/exec), built for speed, reliability, and simplicity.

## 🚀 Why I Built It

I noticed how much time agents spent switching tabs, copying info, and doing repetitive tasks.  
So I built something lightweight that just *fits* into their daily workflow — no installs, no friction, just faster handling and cleaner data.
